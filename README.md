# CODE REVIEW

Hi there! Welcome to this _work-in-progress_ project.
There is no much content yet to see here, but the main purpose of this project is to review certain characteristics of different programming languages. For now, there are just some examples that can be directly executed in order to obtain a better understanding about how such characteristics work. More content will be added progressively!
